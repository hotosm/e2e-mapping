title: Data Conflation (Optional)
description: Conflate with existing map data.

## Summary

- We have field validated data that can be merged into OSM.
- However, first we must check for conflicts in the geometries and tags.
- Our conflation scripts can handle a lot of this, with some manual
  input where necessary.
- This is built directly into the FMTM UI.
- The final validated and tagged geometries are bulk uploaded to OSM.
