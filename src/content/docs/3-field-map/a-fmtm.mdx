:::tip[Summary]

- Now we have validated, AI-generated features for an area, they can be field
  validated and tagged.
- As part of a field (mobile) survey, the features will be validated and tagged
  with useful information.
- The final validated and tagged geometries will be bulk uploaded to OSM in the
  next step.

:::note
It might be useful to first validate geometries in the field using
the Vespucci mobile app.
