description: Collect base imagery.

## Summary

- We need to collect basemap imagery that we can generate map features from.
- For example we can trace building footprints very accurately from
  high-resolution drone imagery (much better than satellite).
- Imagery will be collected collaboratively via Drone Tasking Manager
  (Drone TM), where an area is subdivided into tasks and users collect imagery 
  for each task.
- The collected imagery is stitched together into one large image.

## Step 1: Create an account

...

## Step 5: Create the final image

- From all collected imagery we need to produce what is called an ortho-mosaic.
- This is simply all collected images merged into a single image, with
  georeferencing so where know where the image is located on a map.
- The collected images from Drone TM must be pre-processed using the EXIF
  information on images (when and where the photo was taken).
- Then the images are uploaded to Open Drone Map (ODM) for processing.
