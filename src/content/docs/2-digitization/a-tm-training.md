## Summary

- The TMS URL from OAM can be used as a base layer in Tasking Manager.
- The instance of Tasking Manager available at 
  [https://train.hotosm.org](https://train.hotosm.org) is
  not linked to standard OpenStreetMap (OSM), but instead to a 'sandbox' version.
- Only a small area (10-20%) must be digitised from the imagery for a training
  dataset, as the remainder can be generated via [fAIr](./b-fair.md)
