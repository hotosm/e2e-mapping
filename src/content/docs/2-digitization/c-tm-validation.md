## Summary

- The generated geometries from fAIr can be loaded into another tasking
  manager instance [https://validate.hotosm.org](https://validate.hotosm.org).
- Validators can then lock task areas for validation and validate the generated
  geometries are correct, or provide feedback if issues.
- MapSwipe could also be used at this stage.
