title: Creating a Training Dataset
description: Generate a training dataset for fAIr.
---

:::tip[Summary]
- We must collaboratively generate a sample (training) dataset for the area,
  around 10-20% of total digitized features.
- With this training data we can run [fAIr](./b-fair.md) in the next step to
  generate the remaining features.
- We have two options:
  - uMap
  - Modified Tasking Manager
:::

## Option 1: UMap

- Choose a uMap instance to use [1](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/)
  [2](https://umap.hotosm.org)
- Create a new project, add the TMS URL from OpenAerialMap (if available).
- Send the project link to digitizers.
- Map collaboratively, with real-time updates.
- Export the final GeoJSON.

## Option 2: Tasking Manager

- The TMS URL from OAM can be used as a base layer in Tasking Manager.
- The instance of Tasking Manager available at 
  [https://train.hotosm.org](https://train.hotosm.org) is
  not linked to standard OpenStreetMap (OSM), but instead to a 'sandbox' version.
