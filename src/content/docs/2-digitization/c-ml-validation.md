:::tip[Summary]
- The generated geometries from fAIr can be loaded into another tasking
  manager instance [https://validate.hotosm.org](https://validate.hotosm.org).
- Validators can then lock task areas for validation and validate the generated
  geometries are correct, or provide feedback if issues.
- MapSwipe could also be used at this stage.

## Step 5: Feedback for fAIr (Optional)

- If the predictions are not good enough, then fAIr can try again using
  the validation feedback.
- The corrected features are loaded into fAIr and the model is re-trained.
- This step could be done multiple times.
